Write a program that counts lines and characters in a file
(similar to `wc` Unix-utility, for additional info about it follow the link:
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/wc-command-linux-examples/ or
in case you have macOS or Linux - just call manual for this utility via command: `man wc`).
 Create a Python module called `mymod.py`, which has three functions:
    count_lines(name) function that reads an input file and counts the number of lines in it
    (hint: file.readlines() does most of the work for you, and `len` does the rest)
    count_chars(name) function that reads an input file and counts the number of characters in it
    (hint: file.read() returns a single string)
    test(name) function that calls both counting functions with a given input file name.
